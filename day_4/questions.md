## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?   
- The purpose of a method is so that you can use a certain code block in a lot
of different places in code without having the code in those spots over and over.
With a method, you can call it to reference the code in different places. This
helps take away duplication and also helps organize your code better.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.   
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and
prints `"#{name} I am"`.   
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?   
`hello_someone("Jenny")`
