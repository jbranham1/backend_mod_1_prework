#H3 Array Methods
1. **Sort**
- Sort takes an array and sorts it to go from smallest to largest element.  
2. **Each**
- Each goes through each element in the array. Within the each you can do
whatever with the element.
3. **Join**
- Join takes all of the elements in an array and puts them into one string.
If you pass in a parameter, it will put the parameter between each element
 in the array.
4. **Index**
- Index takes in a parameter. The parameter will be something from the array.
It will return the index, or the position, of the element in the array.
Nil is returned if the parameter is not part of the array.
5. **Include**
- Include takes in a parameter and looks to see if the array contains
that parameter. It returns a true or false (boolean) value.
6. **Collect**
- Collect creates a new array that has the values in the block of code.
You can use this to change all the elements in the array.
7. **First**
- First returns the first value in the array.
8. **Last**
- Last returns the last value in the array.
9. **Shuffle**
- Shuffle randomly shuffles the array and changes the position, or index, of
each element in the array. It returns a new array that is shuffled
and keeps the original array the same.
